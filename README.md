# Code Lettering Explorations

Included in this repo are images of lettering done as exploration based on Wes Bos’s fantastic [javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, as well as his [sticker packs](https://bos.af/). Due to a scarcity of time as I prep for type]media 2018, I do not have current capacity to refine these into artwork with a quality suitable for production in print or web. 

However, since these explorations already exist, they are posted here as hi-res JPEGs for inspiration or even direct use – and ideally refinement, if anyone is so inclined. In the javascript30 folder, several extra characters are included  which have better outlines and could be photoshopped / vector-edited into the primary composition.

The artwork in the livefastwritecode folder is still less complete, and is merely an early study showing how it may work best to connect only a few letters horizontally (e.g. `FA`, `WR` , and `TE` ligatures), and might be possible to take some cues from the command line (a `$` in `FAST` and the inclusion of a final cursor).

A big thanks to Wes Bos for the inspiration and education!
